Lights
======

Weekend project to control RGB strip lighting with a Raspberry Pi (or any computer) and an Arduino.

Uses an Arduino as a standalone controller for strip lighting. Also includes Nodejs application to display a web interface that communicates with the Arduino over serial. This means you can control the lighting from anything with a web browser.
